I’m attaching a full set of screenshots from Lovable, showing how the “New Visit” workflow should look and function.

The goal is for our system’s “New Visit” flow to look and behave very similarly to these examples — keeping the same step order, layout style, and usability.

🎯 Design and Flow Requirements
🧭 Step 0 – Location Validation

When the user clicks “New Visit”, they should see a clean two-step selector:
1️⃣ Select Chain – a simple list of cards showing all available chains (like in the first screenshot).
2️⃣ Select Store – once a chain is selected, only stores with valid coordinates should appear.

Each store card must display:

Store name, city, and chain.

Distance (e.g., “640 m away”).

A color badge showing status:

🟢 In range

🔴 Out of range

🟡 No coordinates

A green confirmation banner when location is successfully obtained.

A “Continue (Test Mode)” button available only for administrators, following the same visual style from the images.

🍓 Step 1 – Product Selection

Display all active products in a grid of visual cards, just like in Lovable.
Each card should include:

Product icon and color.

Product name.

Small label “Berry Fresh.”

Button “Start Evaluation.”

Products are loaded directly from Settings → Products.

📦 Step 2 – Availability

Keep the clean form layout with the top progress bar.

Fields to include:

Available quantity

Location

Display condition

Area photo

Follow the same formatting as in the screenshots: white background, purple accent buttons, and clear spacing between fields.

🌿 Step 3 – Quality

Include a slider bar for “Freshness (1–5)” with a numeric value displayed on the right.

Fields:

Appearance

Packaging condition

Expiration date (with automatic yellow warning if near expiration)

Temperature

Product photos (up to 3)

Show yellow alert text:

⚠️ “Product close to expiration.”

💰 Step 4 – Prices and Promotions

Maintain the same spacing and layout style.

Fields:

Current price

Suggested/competitor price

Automatic price variation (%)

Active promotions (multi-select options)

Promotion description

Checkbox “POP Material Present”

If checked → show additional field “POP Material Photo”

Price tag photo

⚠️ Step 5 – Incidents

Fields:

Incident type (multi-select):
Expired product, Damaged packaging, Missing promotion, Aggressive competition, Wrong price, Out of stock, Other.

Severity level (only if at least one incident is selected).

Required action.

Evidence photos (up to 4).

Detected competition (optional free text).

✅ Final Behavior

Each step dynamically loads its fields based on the configuration from Settings → Evaluations.

Keep purple as the main accent color with a clean, minimal layout.

Show a real-time progress bar at the top labeled “Step X of 5.”

After completion, display the success message:

✅ “Evaluation completed and saved successfully.”

💡 Visual Guidelines

Please use the attached screenshots as reference for:

Layout spacing and typography.

Step transitions and progress visuals.

Consistent use of purple tones and light backgrounds.

Responsive design for mobile and tablet.

🎯 Final Objective

The “New Visit” flow should feel just as smooth, modern, and user-friendly as the Lovable version, following the same step sequence and visual style shown in the screenshots.
