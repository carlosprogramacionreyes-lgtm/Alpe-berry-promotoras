Excellent progress — everything looks great so far!

For the next step, please focus on option B: implement case-insensitive validation across all modules (Users, Chains, Zones, Stores, and Products).

This means all name and unique field comparisons should ignore uppercase and lowercase differences.
Example: “Monterrey” and “monterrey” must be treated as the same value and prevented as duplicates.

🔹 Next Step – Option A: Multiple Store Assignments

Once option B is fully completed and tested, please move on to option A, implementing multiple store assignments inside the Configuration module.

Requirements:

Update the Assignments UI so each user can be assigned to multiple stores at once.

Use checkboxes or a multi-select interface to allow admins to choose multiple stores in one action.

When reopening the assignment modal, previously assigned stores must remain checked.

Adding new stores should not remove existing ones.

Keep the current visual style and layout of the module.

Ensure all updates persist correctly in the user_store_assignments table.

Show success/error toast notifications for each operation.

After this feature is fully implemented and tested, continue to the next step.

🔹 Final Step (for now) – Option C: “Data Base” Tab (Admin Only)

After completing the multi-store assignments, add a new tab under the Configuration module called “Data Base”, visible only to users with admin or superadmin roles.

Requirements:

Add a button labeled “📥 Download database structure”.

When pressed, open a password modal before allowing the action.

Message: “Enter the password to continue.”

Valid password: Cari2230*

If the password is correct:

Generate a .sql file containing only the database structure (no data).

Automatically download the file in the admin’s browser.

Save a copy on the server under /server/backups/.

File name format example: estructura_bd_2025-10-20_18-45.sql.

If the password is incorrect:

Show: “❌ Incorrect password. Backup not generated.”

If completed successfully:

Show: “✅ Database structure downloaded successfully.”

Download History:

Use the backup_logs table to record every backup with:

File name

Admin user

Date and time

Display this history in a table below the button with columns: Date and Time | User | File.

Restrictions:

Only admin and superadmin roles can view and use this tab.

Only export the structure — no data.

Files must remain stored locally under /server/backups/ for SSH/SFTP access.

Design:

Keep the same visual style as the current Configuration panel.

Add a database icon in the sidebar.

Display the history in a clean Card or DataTable component, with pagination if needed.

✅ Development order:
1️⃣ Complete the case-insensitive validation (B)
2️⃣ Implement multiple store assignments (A)
3️⃣ Add the “Data Base” backup tab (C)
