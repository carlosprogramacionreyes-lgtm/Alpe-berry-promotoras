Pending Tasks to Implement (Next Phase)
🏬 1. Add Geofence Field (Configuration → Stores)

Add a new numeric field “Geofence radius (meters)” to the store form.

Only Supervisors and Admins can edit this field.

The value defines the GPS validation radius used in the “New Visit” workflow (e.g., 100, 200, 500 meters).

It replaces the current hardcoded 100 m value.

⚙️ 2. Add Evaluations Tab (Configuration → Evaluations)

Create a new tab called “Evaluations” in the Configuration section.

Purpose: Let administrators control which fields appear in each evaluation step and whether they’re required or optional.

The tab must include:

5 subtabs:
1️⃣ Availability
2️⃣ Quality
3️⃣ Prices
4️⃣ Incidents
5️⃣ Custom Fields

Each subtab shows a table of fields with:

Step name

Technical name (unique key)

Label (display text)

Field type (text, number, select, checkbox, date, etc.)

Options (JSON format, for select fields)

Required toggle

Order number

Status (Active/Inactive)

CRUD support (Add, Edit, Delete, Activate/Deactivate).

Only Administrators can modify this configuration.

Changing a field here should instantly affect the form shown in “New Visit”.

📷 3. Add Camera Buttons

Add a small 📷 camera icon button in the following fields to allow direct photo capture:

Step 2 (Availability): “Area Photo”

Step 3 (Quality): “Product Photos (up to 3)”

Step 4 (Prices): “Price Tag Photo”
Each should open the device camera and allow continuing even if no photo is taken (photo optional).

🍓 4. Modernize Product Selection Screen

Update the “Select Product” screen to look modern and visual, similar to the Lovable design.

Each product card must include:

Product icon and color.

Product name.

Label “Berry Fresh.”

Button “Start Evaluation.”

Display cards in a responsive, clean grid layout with proper spacing.

🧭 5. Direct Start on Store Selection

When clicking “New Visit”, the system should go directly to the “Select Store” screen.

The user should not have to choose the chain first.

🎨 6. Global UI & Spacing Optimization

Review the entire project layout for visual consistency and cleanliness.

Adjust spacing, margins, and padding to make the interface cleaner and easier to read.

Ensure proper alignment between components (tables, forms, cards).

Improve responsiveness for mobile and tablet.

Maintain the purple accent color and minimalist design aesthetic.

✅ Expected Final Behavior

Once these tasks are completed:

The New Visit flow will be fully functional, modern, and mobile-optimized.

The Configuration module will have complete control over evaluation fields and geofencing.

The overall UI will look more polished and professional.
