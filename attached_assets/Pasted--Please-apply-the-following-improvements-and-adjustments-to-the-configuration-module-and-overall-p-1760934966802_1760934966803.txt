‚öôÔ∏è Please apply the following improvements and adjustments to the configuration module and overall project organization:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Make all configuration sections (Users, Chains, Zones, Stores, Products, Evaluations) case-insensitive.
When comparing or validating names or unique fields, it should not matter if the user types uppercase or lowercase letters.

2Ô∏è‚É£ In the Users section, make the email field optional since many users do not have one.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Add full editing functionality in the Users section.
Administrators should be able to modify username, name, role, and password, and see a confirmation message when the change is saved.

4Ô∏è‚É£ In the Chains section, enable editing so names and descriptions can be modified.

5Ô∏è‚É£ In the Zones section, enable editing so zone information and its chain relationship can be updated.

6Ô∏è‚É£ In the Stores section, enable editing so name, address, city, and related chain/zone can be updated.

7Ô∏è‚É£ In the Stores section, add longitude and latitude fields.
These will later be used for the geolocation of store visits.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Add a new section called ‚ÄúAssignments‚Äù under Configuration.
This will allow administrators to assign which stores each user can access or see, with an interface that lists users and lets admins select stores for each one.

9Ô∏è‚É£ In the Products section, enable editing so product name, color, and icon can be updated.

üîü Reorganize the project files into a clean and professional folder structure.
Right now, many files are loose in the root of the project, and it looks disorganized.
Group everything properly by client, server, components, and pages, making sure all imports still work after reorganization.

‚öôÔ∏è Keep the same database schema for all existing modules.
Only create new fields or tables when strictly necessary (for example, latitude/longitude or assignments).

‚úÖ The goal is to make all configuration sections fully editable, connected to the real database, and organized in a clean structure without breaking the design or existing functionality.
